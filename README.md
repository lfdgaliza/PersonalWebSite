# Galiza's experimental project

The principal goal here is to apply as most as possible all technologies described in my Resume.

Also, as a roadmap, I want to make some articles about my experience in doing that in order to explain to other people how to use them.

## Used technologies until now

- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) & [ngx-bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-bootstrap)
- [Angular 5](http://angular.io/) `  + TypeScript`
- HTML, CSS & JavaScript
- [GitHub](http://github.com)
- [Aws](http://aws.amazon.com)
    - S3 `(Hosting)`
    - Route 53 `(To handle the domain)`
